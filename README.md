### Features of the program:
1. **Adding Students**: You can add a student by entering their name, roll number, and marks.
2. **Displaying Students**: All student records can be displayed, showing their name, roll number, marks, and calculated grade.
3. **Editing Students**: Modify a student's name or marks based on their roll number.
4. **Deleting Students**: Remove a student's record based on their roll number.
5. **Finding Students**: Search and display a studentâ€™s details using their roll number.

### How it works:
- A `Student` class holds the student's name, roll number, marks, and calculated grade.
- A `StudentManagementSystem` class manages all student records and provides functions to add, display, edit, delete, and find students.
- The `main` function offers a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the system.

The program is simple and can be extended to handle more complex features like persistence (saving to files), advanced grade calculations, or more student attributes.
